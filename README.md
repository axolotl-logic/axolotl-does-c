This project is meant as a starter for small to medium sized C applications.

In addition to a build system and bike shedding, it includes Static Site Generation (SSG), CI/CD, Unit Testing (via Criterion), and Fuzzing (via AFL++).

It is designed to be modular and opinionated with maximimum observability.
